# Data-Mining-Comparative-Study
This repository explores the performance of different data mining algorithms applied to the same dataset.

### Goal:

- Analyze the effectiveness of various algorithms for data mining tasks.
- Compare and contrast the results obtained from different approaches.
- Gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.

### Dataset:

[[Adult](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult)]

### Algorithm:

- k-means clustering

### Evaluation Metrics:

- Euclidean distance between points

### Repository Structure:

- `data`: Folder containing the dataset used in the study.
- `code`: Folder containing code implementations for each algorithm.
- `document`: Folder containing individual reports for each algorithm.
- `readme.md`: This file.

### Requirements:

- Python 3.11.1
- NumPy
- Pandas

### Instructions:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the scripts in the `code` folder for each algorithm.
4. Analyze the results and generate reports in the `reports` folder.
5. Compare and contrast the results across different algorithms.
